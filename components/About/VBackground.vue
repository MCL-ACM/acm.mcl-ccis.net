        The Malayan Colleges Laguna ACM Student Chapter is the first Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) student chapter 
        in the CALABARZON region. It was founded on August 13, 2018, with MCL CCIS Dean Khristian Kikuchi as its adviser and 
        Mr. John Disonglo as its first president.<br />
        MCL-ACM fosters computing excellence within its members and the MCL community by hosting programming-related events and 
        peer mentoring for IT courses. It also aims to build a versatile community and encourage relaxation by providing social 
        events for the students to enjoy.
